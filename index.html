          <p>
            I am Mulder, a Maine Coon cat who thinks he's a dog. I have many
            skills and attributes to offer the business world including problem
            solving, creative thinking and negotiation. I am an excellent team
            player but also work well independently.
          </p>

          <h4>Problem Solving</h4>
          <p>
            Overcoming my lack of opposable thumbs, I have trained myself to
            open cupboards and fridges, turn the kitchen tap on and many other
            useful tasks. Once I have learnt something I tend to retain the
            knowledge forever. I am also ruthlessly efficient in what I learn,
            for example I have never seen the benefit of learning how to turn
            the tap off again.
          </p>
          <h4>Teamwork</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I have worked well with colleagues to achieve things my employers
              never thought possible, like getting into the kitchen bin to eat
              eggshells or opening a sealed cupboard and chewing through the big
              food bags.
            </li>
            <li>
              I have been a mentor to new members of the team, and successfully
              built relationships with colleagues even though they stole my
              favourite sleeping spots.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am friendly and approachable and always supportive of
              colleagues, will never hiss or scratch.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Negotiation Skills</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Succesfully negotiated for meal times to be earlier on a regular
              basis since starting in my role.
            </li>
            <li>Increased number of treats by trading them for cute tricks.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Communication Skills</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I am vocal and articulate, known as a good communicator with both
              colleagues and my employer
            </li>
            <li>
              I have extensive experience in delivering training and
              presentations, and am particularly well regarded for my persuasive
              dinner speeches. Here is an example of one of my relatives making
              a similarly persuasive argument in the style I use every day for
              my employer:

            Duties include: sleeping, ensuring self and colleagues are

          <p>
            <span class="service-length">March - April 2019</span> - During my
            annual leave when my employer went travelling I had the opportunity
            to volunteer my services as an experienced cat to other people. I
            enjoyed giving back and upskilling people who had never worked with
            cats before about how to scratch my ears. They have gone on to
            become successful cat employers in their own right, and I am proud
            to have contributed to their development.
          </p>

            I received a positive reference from this time which prospective
            employers are welcome to listen to to find out more about my work:
